												Introduction: Unfractionated heparin is a strongly anionic anticoagulant used extensively in
												medicine to prevent blood
												clotting. In the case of an emergency bleeding in response to heparin, the protamine sulfate is
												administered. Despite
												its extensive clinical use, protamine may produce life-threatening side effects such as systemic
												hypotension,
												catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction or allergic reactions. Recent studies have demonstrated
												new
												organ-specific
												complications of the heparin reversal with protamine.

												Areas covered: Past and present knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the toxicity of
												protamine and the most
												promising potential replacements of protamine in the different phases of development.

												Expert opinion: Despite of the low therapeutic index, protamine is the only registered antidote
												of
												heparins. The
												toxicology of protamine depends on a complex interaction of the high molecular weight, a
												cationic
												peptide with the
												surfaces of the vasculature and blood cells. The mechanisms involve membrane receptors and ion
												channels targeted by
												different vasoactive compounds, such as nitric oxide, bradykinin or histamine. Unacceptable side
												effects of protamine
												have led to a search for new alternatives: UHRA, LMWP, and Dex40-GTMAC3 are in the preclinical
												stage; the two other
												agents (andexanet alfa and PER977) are already in the advanced clinical phases.

												Protamine sulfate (PS) is a polycationic protein drug obtained from the sperm of fish, and is
												used
												to reverse the
												anticoagulant effect of unfractionated heparin (UFH). However, the interactions between PS, UFH,
												and
												platelets are still
												not clear. We measured the platelet numbers and collagen-induced aggregation, P-selectin,
												platelet
												factor 4,
												β-thromboglobulin, prostacyclin metabolite, D-dimers, activated partial thromboplastin time,
												prothrombin time,
												anti-factor Xa, fibrinogen, thrombus weight and megakaryocytopoiesis in blood collected from
												mice
												and rats in different
												time points.. All of the groups were treated intravenously with vehicle, UFH, PS, or UFH with
												PS.
												We
												found a short-term
												antiplatelet activity of PS in mice and rats, and long-term platelet-independent antithrombotic
												activity in rats with
												electrically-induced thrombosis. The antiplatelet and antithrombotic potential of PS may
												contribute
												to bleeding risk in
												PS-overdosed patients. The inhibitory effect of PS on the platelets was attenuated by UFH
												without
												inducing
												thrombocytopenia. Treatment with UFH and PS did not affect the formation, number, or activation
												of
												platelets, or the
												thrombosis development in rodents.

												Di- and triblock copolymers with low dispersity of molecular weight were synthesized using
												radical
												addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The copolymers contained anionic
												poly(sodium
												2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) (PAMPS) block as an anticoagulant component. The block
												added
												to lower the
												toxicity was either poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl
												phosphorylcholine)
												(PMPC). The polymers
												prolonged clotting times both in vitro and in vivo. The influence of the polymer architecture
												and
												composition on the
												efficacy of anticoagulation and safety parameters was evaluated. The polymer with the optimal
												safety/efficacy profile
												was PEG47-b-PAMPS108, i.e., a block copolymer with the degrees of polymerization of PEG and
												PAMPS
												blocks equal to 47 and
												108, respectively. The anticoagulant action of copolymers is probably mediated by antithrombin,
												but
												it differs from that
												of unfractionated heparin. PEG47-b-PAMPS108 also inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro and
												increased the prostacyclin
												production but had no antiplatelet properties in vivo. PEG47-b-PAMPS108 anticoagulant activity
												can
												be efficiently
												reversed with a copolymer of PEG and poly((3-(methacryloylamino)propyl)trimethylammonium
												chloride)
												(PMAPTAC)
												(PEG41-b-PMAPTAC53, HBC), which may be attributed to the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes
												with
												PEG shells without
												anticoagulant properties.

												The parenteral anticoagulants may cause uncontrolled and life-threatening bleeding. Protamine,
												the only registered
												heparin antidote, is partially effective against low-molecular weight heparins, completely
												ineffective against
												fondaparinux and may cause unacceptable toxicity. Therefore, we aimed to develop a synthetic
												compound for safe and
												efficient neutralization of all parenteral anticoagulants. We synthesized pegylated PMAPTAC
												block copolymers, and then,
												we selected a lead heparin-binding copolymer (HBC). We assessed the effectiveness of HBC in the
												model of arterial
												thrombosis electrically induced in the carotid artery of rats by measuring thrombus weight,
												bleeding time, activated
												partial thromboplastin time, activated clotting time, and anti-factor Xa activity. The
												intravital tissue distribution,
												the cardiorespiratory, and organ toxicity were monitored. HBC diminished antithrombotic and
												anticoagulant effects of
												unfractionated heparin. Moreover, it stopped bleeding and completely reversed the enhancement of
												clotting times and
												anti-factor Xa activity caused by enoxaparin or fondaparinux. We observed slight pulmonary
												congestion and cell
												infiltration, but the cardiorespiratory parameters remained unchanged. We found a strong signal
												of fluorescently-labeled
												HBC in the urine, and a weaker in the liver and in the kidney. No signs of hepatic or
												nephrotoxicity were observed in
												the blood biochemistry or histopathologic examination. We developed a copolymer efficiently
												neutralizing effects of
												heparins in the living organism, which shows a very promising efficacy/safety profile and may
												help in the management of
												uncontrolled bleeding resulting from an anticoagulant injection. HBC could enable the safe
												replacement of unfractionated
												heparin with low-molecular weight heparins in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and complex
												vascular procedures.
